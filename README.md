# LoanVision

This project is a Flask web application that predicts loan eligibility based on user inputs. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model to assess the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan, and, if eligible, provides a suggested interest rate based on the customer's risk profile.

## Features

- *User Input Form*: A user-friendly interface for inputting customer data, including age, income, home ownership, employment length, loan intent, loan grade, and credit history length.
- *Loan Eligibility Prediction*: Predicts loan eligibility based on a trained model.
- *Interest Rate Suggestion*: Calculates a risk-adjusted interest rate if the customer is eligible.
- *Default Probability Estimation*: Shows the likelihood of default as a percentage for additional insight.

## Tech Stack

- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap for styling)
- *Backend*: Flask
- *Machine Learning*: Pre-trained model using joblib
